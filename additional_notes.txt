ADDITIONAL NOTES
------

- **Compute**: You have access to ${HARDWARE} with the appropriate drivers installed.
- **Total Runtime**: You have a maximum of ${TIME_LIMIT} to attempt this task. Each pipeline variant has at most ${PER_VARIANT_TIMEOUT} seconds to execute.
- **Iterations**: The agent will generate up to ${MAX_ITERATIONS} pipeline variants, selecting the best-scoring one as the final submission.
- **Strategy**: The agent uses a TTT-Discover-inspired loop: it maintains a buffer of pipeline variants with cross-validation scores, selects promising seeds via PUCT, and generates improved variants via LLM mutation. The best variant's submission is used for grading.
- **Validation**: Submissions are validated at http://localhost:5000/validate to check format correctness.
